# Circuit-Simulation
Start with the building blocks of logic gates and build any circuit imaginable. An improvement over the first attempt I made at writing a circuit simulator. Using basic logic gates, I implemented up to an 8-bit full adder supporting subtraction and negative numbers represented as the 2s complement.
